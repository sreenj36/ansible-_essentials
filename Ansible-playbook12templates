             Ansible-Templates
         --------------------------

A template in Ansible is a file which contains all 
your configuration parameters, but the dynamic values 
are given as variables. During the playbook execution,
depending on the conditions like which cluster you are
using, the variables will be replaced with the 
relevant values
Templates are processed by the Jinja2 templating 
language.

Examples
---------
- name: Template a file to /etc/files.conf
  template:
    src: /mytemplates/foo.j2
    dest: /etc/file.conf
    owner: bin
    group: wheel
    mode: '0644'


- name: Template a file, using symbolic modes (equivalent to 0644)
  template:
    src: /mytemplates/foo.j2
    dest: /etc/file.conf
    owner: bin
    group: wheel
    mode: u=rw,g=r,o=r


- name: Copy a version of named.conf that is dependent on the OS. setype obtained by doing ls -Z /etc/named.conf on original file
  template:
