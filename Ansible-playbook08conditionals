                 The When Statement
              ----------------------- 
Sometimes you will want to skip a particular step on a 
particular host. This could be something as simple as 
not installing a certain package if the operating 
system is a particular version, or it could be 
something like performing some cleanup steps if a 
filesystem is getting full.

This is easy to do in Ansible with the when clause, 
which contains a raw Jinja2 expression without double 
curly braces (see group_by – Create Ansible groups 
based on facts). It’s actually pretty simple:
Examples
--------
tasks:
  - name: "shut down Debian flavored systems"
    command: /sbin/shutdown -t now
    when: ansible_facts['os_family'] == "Debian"
    
# note that all variables can be used directly in 
conditionals without double curly braces
You can also use parentheses to group conditions:

tasks:
  - name: "shut down CentOS 6 and Debian 7 systems"
    command: /sbin/shutdown -t now
    when: (ansible_facts['distribution'] == "CentOS" 

and ansible_facts['distribution_major_version'] == "6")
 or
  (ansible_facts['distribution'] == "Debian" and 
ansible_facts['distribution_major_version'] == "7")
