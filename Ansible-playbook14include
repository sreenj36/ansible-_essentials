                   Ansible-Include
            ---------------------------

Includes a file with a list of plays or tasks to be 
executed in the current playbook. Files with a list of 
plays can only be included at the top level. Lists of 
tasks can only be included where tasks normally run 
(in play). Before Ansible 2.0, all includes were 
'static' and were executed when the play was compiled.
