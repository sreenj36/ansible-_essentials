                 Ansible-variables
            --------------------------
Variable in playbooks are very similar to using 
variables in any programming language. It helps you to 
use and assign a value to a variable and use that 
anywhere in the playbook. One can put conditions around
the value of the variables and accordingly use them in 
the playbook

Example
--------
- hosts : <your hosts> 
  vars:
    - tomcat_port: 8080
