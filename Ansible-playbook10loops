                    Loops
              ----------------
Sometimes you want to repeat a task multiple times. 
In computer programming, this is called a loop. 
Common Ansible loops include changing ownership on 
several files and/or directories with the file module,
creating multiple users with the user module, and 
repeating a polling step until a certain result is 
reached. Ansible offers two keywords for creating 
loops: loop and with_<lookup>.

Example
--------

with_items:
  - 1
  - [2,3]
  - 4


loop: "{{ [1, [2,3] ,4] | flatten(1) }}"
