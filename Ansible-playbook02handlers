                    Ansible Handler
                ......................

Handlers are just like regular tasks in an Ansible 
playbook,but are only run if the Task contains a notify
directive and also indicates that it changed something.

A handler is a task,is called by another task only
execute if a change is made,even if it is called 
multiple times it only runs once.
